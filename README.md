How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The main ways that I can ensure the my code, program, or software is functional and secure is by
utilizing what I learned from this class and from CS-305 to ensure that all of the code has been
tested to the best of my ability and to also ensure that there are no exploited vulnerabilities 
found in the APIs that I use in the program.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The main way that I interpret user needs is by determining the requirements from what the users 
explain they would like. I then create wireframes that allow the users to see what the design of the
program would look like to ensure they are happy with how everything looks.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by finding out what the users would like to see via requirements and
by also following the ADA that requires developers to follow certain design standards to ensure everyone
has a good experience online.
